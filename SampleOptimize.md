## Description ##
Execute ozz::animation::offline::AnimationOptimizer on a raw animation object to remove redundant keyframes (within a tolerance). Raw objects (a skeleton and an animation) are loaded from a Collada document. This samples can display optimized and non-optimized version of the animation, as well as the difference between the two (aka the error generated by the optimizer).

## Concept ##
This sample imports a skeleton and an animation from Collada documents. It makes use of ozz\_animation\_collada helper library to extract raw (aka offline, programmer friendly) animation and skeleton (see ozz::animation::offline::collada namespace) from the Collada documents. Those raw objects are then converted to run-time objects using animation and skeleton builder utilities.
Prior to the conversion, animation is optimized by removing redundant keyframes (within a tolerance). It uses ozz::animation::offline::AnimationOptimizer objects that takes as input a raw animation and outputs a new optimized one.

## Sample usage ##
This samples allows to tweak animation key-frame optimization stage using "translation", "rotation" and "scale" sliders in the "Optimization tolerances" UI panel. Optimization result can be checked within the sample:
  * Optimization quality: 3 rendering mode are provided to check optimization quality:
  * "Non-optimized": Renders the animation as close as the raw version as possible. No tolerance optimization is performed.
  * "Optimized" (default): Result of the optimization pass, using sample tolerances.
  * "Difference": Renders only the difference between the optimized and raw animation. This makes easy to detect quality degradation.
  * Optimization quantity: Run-time animation size is displayed in the UI.
Some other parameters can be tuned from sample UI to affect animation playback:
  * Play/pause animation.
  * Fix animation time.
  * Set playback speed, which can be negative to go backward.

## Implementation ##
  1. Import skeleton object:
    1. Import ozz::animation::offline::RawSkeleton object using ozz::animation::offline::collada::ImportFromFile function. This RawSkeleton is in an offline suitable format, meaning it can be programmatically modified: Add/remove/rename joints...
    1. Convert the RawSkeleton (aka offline) object to a runtime ozz::animation::offline::Skeleton, using ozz::animation::offline::SkeletonBuilder. This offline utility does the conversion to the runtime format, which can then be serialized or used by the runtime API. It cannot be modified though.
  1. Import animation object:
    1. Import ozz::animation::offline::RawAnimation object using ozz::animation::offline::collada::ImportFromFile function. This RawAnimation is in an offline suitable format, meaning it can be programmatically modified: Add/remove keys, add/remove tracks, change duration, extract motion...
    1. Optimizes animation size by removing keyframes that are within a certain tolerance value. This is done with ozz::animation::offline::AnimationOptimizer which process a offline animation (RawAnimation), and outputs an new offline animation. Optimization tolerance values are translation (meter), rotation (radian) and scale (percentage).
    1. Convert the offline animation to a runtime format, using ozz::animation::offline::AnimationBuilder. This utility takes as input a RawAnimation and outputs a runtime ozz::animation::Animation. The runtime format is the one used for sampling. In opposition with the offline one, it cannot be edited/modified. It is optimized for runtime usage in term of memory layout (cache coherence for sampling) and footprint (compression scheme).
  1. The remaining code of the sample is to allocate runtime buffers and samples animation every frame. See playback sample for more details.
